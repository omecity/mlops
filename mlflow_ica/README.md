# MLflow Linear Models with x1 and x2

This project trains and tracks simple linear regression models using [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).
The script automatically evaluates models on subsets of the columns **x1** and **x2** against the target column **y**, then logs metrics and models to MLflow.
